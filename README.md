PROG6212 POE
For the final part of the POE i have created a web application implemented from the previous parts of the POE, this is by converting the student desktop application that used console app to Asp.net.core web
## How The Application Runs
firstly you run the app
the statup view page will show you "Welcome"
at the top theres a tab with different headings to choose from
if iyou choose to select student details it allows you to add new student details
if you choose to select module record it allows you to add new module records
if you choose yo select module calculation it allows you to add new modules to calculate self study hours
the list will then show from the first view page of the tab you have selected from
## What does not run from the app
the gragh fails to show 
the list from the database fails to show on the view index tab, the user will be able to add from the web application and the data is saved to the SQL database but the list does not show on the web app
